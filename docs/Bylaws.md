**BYLAWS OF THE CA/BROWSER FORUM** 

**Version 1.7 - Adopted effective as of 6 July 2017**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_


**1.  CA/BROWSER FORUM – PURPOSE, STATUS, AND ANTITRUST LAWS**

**1.1        Purpose of the Forum:**

The Certification Authority Browser Forum (CA/Browser Forum) is a voluntary gathering of leading certification authorities (CAs) and vendors of Internet browser software and other applications.

Members of the CA/Browser Forum have worked closely together in defining the guidelines and means of implementation for best practices as a way of providing a heightened security for Internet transactions and creating a more intuitive method of displaying secure sites to Internet users.

**1.2        Status of the Forum and Forum Activities**

The Forum has no corporate or association status, but is simply a group of CAs and browsers which communicates or meets from time to time to discuss matters of common interest relevant to the Forum's purpose.  The Forum has no regulatory or industry powers over its members or others.  Other than those rights and responsibilities found in the Forum's Intellectual Property Rights Policy (IPR), Forum "membership" or other participation status does not convey any legal status or rights, but is intended simply as a guide to the levels of participation in Forum activities.

**1.3        Intellectual Property Rights Policy; Antitrust Laws and Regulations; Goal; Conduct**

Forum Members, Associate Members, and Interested Parties must comply with the then-current IPR policy and all applicable antitrust laws and regulations during their Forum activities.

The historic goal of Forum activities (including development of proposed requirements and guidelines and voting on all matters) has been to seek substantial consensus among Forum Members before proceeding or adopting final work product, and this goal will remain for the future.  Members shall not use their participation in the Forum either to promote their own products and offerings or to restrict or impede the products and offerings of other Members.

The Chair will read an antitrust compliance statement at the start of all Forum Meetings (and on other occasions, as the Chair deems necessary) in substantially the following form:

"As you know, this meeting includes companies that compete against one another. This meeting is intended to discuss technical standards related to the provision of existing and new types of digital certificates without restricting competition in developing and marketing such certificates. This meeting is not intended to share competitively-sensitive information among competitors, and therefore all participants agree not to discuss or exchange information related to:

(a) Pricing policies, pricing formulas, prices or other terms of sale;

(b) Costs, cost structures, profit margins,

(c) Pending or planned service offerings,

(d) Customers, business, or marketing plans; or

(e) The allocation of customers, territories, or products in any way."



**2.  FORUM MEMBERSHIP AND VOTING**

**2.1        Qualifying for Forum Membership**

(a)        CA/Browser Forum members shall meet at least one of the following criteria.

(1)        __Issuing CA__: The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs audit, or ETSI 102042 or ETSI 101456 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet, such certificates being treated as valid when using a browser created by a Browser member.  Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Associate Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.1 for a period of time to be designated by the Forum.

(2)        __Root CA__: The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs, or ETSI 102042 or ETSI 101456 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to subordinate CAs that, in turn, actively issue certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet, such certificates being treated as valid when using a browser created by a Browser member.  Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Associate Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.1 for a period of time to be designated by the Forum.

(3)        __Browser__: The member organization produces a software product intended for use by the general public for browsing the Web securely.

(b)        Applicants should supply the following information:

(1)        Confirmation that the applicant satisfies at least one of the membership criteria (and if it satisfies more than one, indication of the single category under which the applicant wishes to apply).

(2)        The organization name, as you wish it to appear on the Forum Web site and in official Forum documents.

(3)        URL of the applicant's main Web site.

(4)        Names and email addresses of employees who will participate in the Forum mail list.

(5)        Emergency contact information for security issues related to certificate trust.

CA Applicants should supply the following additional information:
 
(6) URL of the current qualifying performance audit report.

(7) The URL of at least one third party website that includes a certificate issued by the Applicant in the certificate chain.
 
(8) Links or references to issued certificates that demonstrate compliance with all applicable certificate, CRL, and OCSP requirements.


(c)        An Applicant shall become a Member once the Forum has determined by consensus among the Members during a teleconference or meeting that the Applicant meets all of the requirements of subsection (a) or, upon the request of any Member, by a Ballot among the Members.  Acceptance by consensus shall be determined or a Ballot of Members shall be held as soon as the Applicant indicates that it has presented all information required under subsection (b) and has responded to all follow-up questions from the Forum and the Member has complied with the requirements of Section 5.5.

**2.2  Ending Forum Membership**

Forum Members may resign from the Forum at any time. Resignation does not prevent a member potentially having continuing obligations, under the Forum's IPR Policy or any other document.

(a) Browser: A Browser member's membership will automatically cease if any of the following become true:
1.	it stops providing updates for its membership-qualifying software product; or 
2.	six months have elapsed since the last such published update.

(b) Issuing CA or Root CA: A CA member's membership may be suspended if any of the following become true:
1.	it fails to pass its membership-qualifying audit;
2.	its membership-qualifying audit is revoked, rescinded or withdrawn;
3.	fifteen months have elapsed since the end of the Audit Period of its last successful membership-qualifying audit;
4.	it stops issuing certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet; or
5.	it is no longer the case that its currently-issued certificates are treated as valid by at least one Browser member. 

Any Forum Member who believes one of the above circumstances is true of a CA Forum Member may report it on the Public Mail List. The Chair will then investigate, including asking the CA for an explanation or appropriate documentation. If evidence of continued qualification for membership is not forthcoming within five working days, the Chair will announce that the member is suspended, such announcement to include the clause(s) from the above list under which the suspension has been made.

A suspended CA Forum Member who believes it has now re-met the membership criteria under the relevant clauses shall post evidence to the Public Mail List. The Chair will examine the evidence and unsuspend the member, or not, by public announcement. A CA Forum Member's membership will automatically cease six months after it becomes suspended if it has not re-met the membership criteria by that time.

While suspended, CAs may participate in meetings and on the Forum's discussion lists, but not propose or second ballots or take part in any form of voting. Votes cast before a member's suspension is announced will stand.

**2.3        General Provisions Applicable to All Ballots**

The following rules will apply to all ballots, including Draft Guideline Ballots (defined in Section 2.4).

(a)        Only votes by Members shall be accepted.

(b)        Only one vote per Member company shall be accepted; representatives of Affiliates shall not vote.

(c)        A representative of any Member can call for a proposed ballot to be published for discussion and comment by the membership. Any proposed ballot needs two endorsements by other Members in order to proceed. The discussion period then shall take place for at least seven calendar days.  After seven days, wheneverr the proposer feels the ballot is ready for voting, he shall repost the ballot, incorporating any changes based on feedback from the discussion period.  However, if 30 days elapse from the beginning of the discussion period without voting having started, the ballot will be considered withdrawn.  The ballot shall clearly state the start and end dates and times (including time zone) for the voting period.

(d)        Upon completion of the discussion period, Members shall have exactly seven calendar days for voting, with the deadline clearly communicated in the ballot and sent via the Public Mail List. All voting will take place via the Public Mail List.   Votes not submitted to the Public Mail List will not be considered valid, and will not be counted for any purpose.

(e)        Members may vote yes, no, or abstain on a ballot.  Only votes that indicate a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response to the ballot question shall be considered (i.e. votes to abstain and votes that do not indicate a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response will not figure in the calculation of item (f), below).

(f)        Members fall into two categories: CAs (comprising issuing CAs and root CAs, as defined in the membership criteria) and browsers (as defined in the membership criteria). In order for the ballot to be adopted by the Forum, two-thirds or more of the votes cast by the Members in the CA category must be in favor of the ballot, and at least 50% plus one of the votes cast by the members in the browser category must be in favor of the ballot. At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted.

(g)        A ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated. The number of currently active Members is the average number of Member organizations that have participated in the previous three Forum-wide meetings (both teleconferences and face-to-face meetings).  Working Group, subgroup, committee, PAG, and other similar meetings do not count for purposes of calculating the “number of currently active members.”

(h)        The Chair will tabulate and announce the results within 3 business days of the close of the voting period.

(i)        The Chair may delegate any of his/her duties under this Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 to the Vice Chair as necessary, or the Vice Chair may otherwise execute the duties and obligations of the Chair as provided in Section 4.1(a) of these Bylaws.

**2.4        Requirements for Draft Guideline Ballots**

This section applies to any ballot that proposes a Final Guideline or a Final Maintenance Guideline (a “Draft Guideline Ballot”), all as defined under the Forum’s IPR Policy.  Draft Guideline Ballots must comply with the following rules in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 2.3 above.

(a)        A Draft Guideline Ballot will clearly indicate whether it is proposing a Final Guideline or a Final Maintenance Guideline.  If the Draft Guideline Ballot is proposing a Final Guideline, such ballot will include the full text of the Draft Guideline intended to become a Final Guideline.  If the Draft Guideline Ballot is proposing a Final Maintenance Guideline, such ballot will include a redline or comparison showing the set of changes from the Final Guideline section(s) intended to become a Final Maintenance Guideline, and need not include a copy of the full set of guidelines.  Such redline or comparison shall be made against the Final Guideline section(s) as they exist at the time a ballot is proposed, and need not take into consideration other ballots that may be proposed subsequently, except as provided in Section 2.4(j) below.

(b)        As described in Section 2.3(c), there will be a discussion period of at least seven but no more than 14 calendar days before votes are cast on a Draft Guideline Ballot, with the start and end dates of such discussion period clearly specified in the ballot.

(c)        As described in Section 2.3(d), upon completion of such discussion period, Members shall have exactly seven calendar days to vote on a Draft Guideline Ballot, with the deadline clearly communicated in the ballot sent via the Public Mail List. All voting will take place via the Public Mail List.  Votes not submitted to the Public Mail List will not be considered valid, and will not be counted for any purpose.  The Chair may send an email to the Public Mail List reminding Members of when the voting period opens and closes.

(d)        The Forum (via the Chair) will tabulate and announce the results within 3 business days of the close of the initial voting period (the “Initial Vote”).  If the Draft Guidelines Ballot does not pass the Initial Vote, the ballot will stop.

(e)        If a Draft Guideline Ballot passes the Initial Vote, the Chair shall initiate, no later than the 3rd business day after the announcement of the Initial Vote results, the Review Period of 30 or 60 days, as applicable and as described in Section 4.1 of the IPR Policy.  The Chair will initiate the Review Period by sending the Review Notice to both the Member Mail List and the Public Mail List.  The Review Notice will clearly specify the open and close dates and times (with time zone) of the Review Period.  If the Chair does not initiate the Review Period within 5 business days after the announcement of the Initial Vote results, the Vice Chair may initiate the Review Period, using the same process as the Chair would have been required to use.

(f)        The Review Period will continue to the end of the 30- or 60-day period, as applicable, regardless of the number of Exclusion Notices filed pursuant to the IPR Policy during such period, if any.  No later than 3 business days after the conclusion of the applicable Review Period, the Chair will distribute any Exclusion Notices submitted in accordance with Section 4.2 of the IPR Policy via the Public Mail List; provided, however, that the Chair may distribute such Exclusion Notices earlier.

(g)        In addition to following the process for submitting Exclusion Notices set forth in Section 4 of the IPR Policy, Members will also send Exclusion Notices to the Public Mail List as a safeguard.

(h)        If no Exclusion Notices are filed during the Review Period with respect to a Draft Guideline Ballot, then the results of the Initial Vote are automatically deemed to be final and approved, and Draft Guidelines then become either Final Guidelines or Final Maintenance Guidelines, as designated in the Draft Guidelines Ballot.  The Chair will notify both the Member Mail List and the Public Mail List of the final approval within 3 business days, as well as update the Public Website of Final Guidelines and Final Maintenance Guidelines within 10 business days of the close of the Review Period.

(i)        If Exclusion Notice(s) are filed during the Review Period (as described in Section 4.3 of the IPR Policy), then the results of the Initial Vote are automatically rescinded and deemed null and void, and;

(i)        A Patent Advisory Group (PAG) will be formed, in accordance with Section 7 of the IPR Policy, to address the conflict.  The PAG will make a conclusion as described in Section 7.3.2 of the IPR Policy, and communicate such conclusion to the rest of the Forum, using the Member Mail List and the Public Mail List; and

(ii)        After the PAG provides its conclusion, if the proposer and endorsers decide to proceed with the Draft Guidelines Ballot, and:

(A)        The proposer and endorsers do not make any changes to the Draft Guidelines Ballot, such ballot must go through the steps described in Sections 2.4(b) through (d) above, replacing the “Initial Vote” with a “Second Vote.”  If a Draft Guidelines Ballot passes the Second Vote, then the results of the Second Vote are deemed to be final and approved.  Draft Guidelines then become either Final Guidelines or Final Maintenance Guidelines, as designated in the Draft Guidelines Ballot.  The Chair will notify both the Member Mail List and the Public Mail List of the approval, as well as update the public website of Final Guidelines and Final Maintenance Guidelines; or

(B)        The proposer and endorsers make changes to the Draft Guidelines Ballot, a new Draft Guidelines Ballot must be proposed, and must go through the steps described in Sections 2.4(a) through (i) above.

(j)        If a ballot is proposed to amend the same section of the Final Guidelines or the Final Maintenance Guidelines as one or more previous ballot(s) that has/have not yet been finally approved, the newly proposed ballot must include information about, and a link to, any such previous ballot(s), and may include provisions to avoid any conflicts relating to such previous ballots.

**3.  OTHER FORUM PARTICIPATION**

**3.1        Associate Members**

The Forum may enter into associate member relationships with other organizations when the CA/Browser Forum determines that maintaining such a relationship will be of benefit to the work of the Forum.  In the past, entities qualifying as Associate Members have included the AICPA/CICA WebTrust Task Force, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, Paypal, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, tScheme, the U.S. Federal PKI, and CAs applying for membership but awaiting full qualification under Section 2.1.  Participation as an Associate Member is by invitation only.  In order to become an Associate Member, an organization must sign a mutual letter of intent, understanding, or other agreement and the Forum's IPR Agreement, unless this latter requirement is waived in writing by the Forum based on overriding policies of the Associate Member's own organization IPR rules.  Associate Members may attend face-to-face meetings, communicate with Forum Members on member lists, and access Forum wiki content.  Associate Members are not entitled to vote except on special straw polls of the Forum (e.g. when selecting meeting dates, locations, etc.)

**3.2  Interested Parties**

Any person or entity that wishes to participate in the Forum as an Interested Party may do so by providing their name, affiliation (optional), and contact information, and by agreeing to the IPR Agreement attached as Exhibit A (indicating agreement by manual signing or digitally signing the agreement).

Interested Parties may participate in Forum activities in the following ways:

(a)        By becoming involved in Working Groups,

(b)        By posting to the Public Mail List, and

(c)        By participating in those portions of Forum Teleconferences and Forum Meetings to which they are invited by the Forum Chair relating to their areas of special expertise or the subject of their Working Group participation.

Interested Parties are required to comply with the provisions of the IPR Agreement and these Bylaws.  Interested Parties may lose their status as Interested Parties by vote of the Members, in the Members' sole discretion.



**3.3        Other Parties**

The public may follow the Forum's activities by reading all postings on the Public Mail List and the Public Web Site.  Questions or comments to the Forum may be sent to Questions Mail List.



**4.  OFFICERS AND FINANCES**

**4.1        Officers**

(a) Term of office:  The Forum will elect a Chair and Vice Chair, each to serve for a two-year term.  The Vice Chair has the authority of the Chair in the event of any absence or unavailability of the Chair, and in such circumstances, any duty delegated to the Chair herein may be performed by the Vice Chair.  For example, the Vice Chair will preside at Forum Meetings and Forum Teleconferences in the Chair's absence.  The offices of Chair and Vice Chair may only be filled by Forum Member representatives.

No person may serve as Chair for more than a two-year period or be elected to Vice Chair upon expiration or termination of the person's service as Chair, but a person is eligible to be elected as Chair again after having vacated the position as Chair for at least two years.

(b) Manner of conducting nominations:   At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the current Chair's term or upon his/her early termination as Chair, the Chair or Vice Chair will announce through the management mailing list that nominations are open for the office of Chair and the Vice Chair will automatically be nominated as the next Chair, but Forum Members may nominate themselves or others to be additional candidates as Chair.  A Vice Chair may decline the nomination to the office of Chair and/or indicate an intent to seek nomination for re-election to the office of Vice Chair.  The nomination period for Chair will last for at least one week but no longer than four weeks.  Upon the close of the nominations for Chair, the nomination period for the office of Vice Chair shall immediately open. The nomination period for Vice Chair will last for at least one week but no longer than four weeks.

(c) Manner of holding officer elections:   If a single individual is nominated for a position, the Forum will hold a ballot to confirm appointment of the nominee. For the confirmation ballot, each Forum Member is entitled to a single vote regardless of the number of participating Forum Member representatives or whether the Forum Member is categorized as a CA or product supplier. If multiple votes are received from a Forum Member's representatives, the last vote submitted during the voting period is considered the Forum Member's vote.  The single nominee is considered confirmed if a majority of the Forum members who vote are in favor of the appointment, regardless of the number of votes cast and irrespective of whether 2/3 of the CAs or 1/2 of the product suppliers approve appointment of the nominee.

If more than one candidate is nominated for Chair or Vice Chair, the Forum will announce an election ballot to determine which candidate will fill the position.  Within two weeks after the close of the nomination period, the Chair or Vice Chair will establish an election committee and announce the election ballot on the management mailing list along with the ballot start date, ballot end date, and a description of the voting process.  The Chair or Vice Chair will appoint the election committee by selecting at least two volunteers who have a reputation for independence, preferably individuals without voting rights in the Forum and that participate as Interested Parties.  The election committee is responsible solely for tallying Forum Member votes in connection with the election ballot. The description must include the email address(es) where members will send their vote, which should be the email addresses of the election committee.

For election ballots, each Forum Member is entitled to a single vote regardless of the number of participating Forum Member representatives or whether the Forum Member is categorized as a CA or product supplier. If multiple votes are received from a Forum Member's representatives, the last vote submitted during the voting period is considered the Forum Member's vote. Within two weeks after the election ballot closes, the election committee will compile the votes, ensure that only one vote is counted per Forum Member, confirm the results with other members of the election committee, and publish the ballot results by sending an email to the public mailing list.  The election committee will not include any votes submitted before or after the voting period when compiling the votes. The ballot results email will contain only the following information:

a short description of the ballot purpose, the total number of votes submitted during the ballot period, and the name of the nominee receiving the most votes. The election committee may include other language as necessary to accurately describe the ballot and any concerns the election committee had with the ballot, provided that such language does not disclose how individual Forum Members voted.  The election committee will treat the votes of individual Forum Members as confidential information.  The nominee receiving the most votes is appointed to the applicable position, regardless of the number of votes cast and irrespective of whether 2/3 of the CAs or ½ of the product suppliers voted for the nominee. If the election ballot results in a tie among the candidates receiving the most votes, the Chair or Vice Chair will call for another election ballot that includes only the two tying candidates.

(d) Duties:  The Chair and Vice Chair shall exercise their functions in a fair and neutral manner, allowing all Members equal treatment for their comments and proposals, and shall not favor one side over another in any matter (except that the Chair and Vice Chair may indicate their own position during discussion and voting on the matter).  The Chair and Vice Chair shall have no personal liability for any activities of the Forum or its Members or Interested Parties.

The Chair or the Vice Chair may sign correspondence, applications, forms, Letters of Intent, and Memoranda of Understanding relating to projects with standards bodies, industry groups, and other third parties, but shall have no personal liability therefor.

**4.2        Finances**

Because the Forum has no corporate status, it will not maintain funds or banking accounts.  The costs of operating Forum websites or mailing lists will be covered by voluntary contribution from Forum Members (who may seek voluntary contributions from other Members to help defray such costs).  Forum Members may propose other group activities which they propose to sponsor (e.g., research projects, etc.) which require funding and may seek voluntary contributions from other Members for such activities.

Forum Meetings may be held from time to time upon the voluntary sponsorship of one or more Forum members.  The sponsor of a Forum Meeting may suggest a fixed cost per meeting participant as reimbursement to the sponsor to cover (a) the cost of meeting rooms and refreshments, and (b) the cost of any meeting dinner or other group activity.  Sponsors will be encouraged to announce any suggested per-participant fixed cost reimbursement amount in advance of the Forum Meeting for participant planning purposes, and will provide a statement or invoice to each participant upon request after the Forum Meeting for submission to the participant's accounting department.  All per-participant reimbursements shall be paid directly to the sponsor.

Interested Parties will not be required to pay anything for their participation in Forum activities, but must cover their own expenses for participation in any Working Group meetings.

**5.  FORUM ACTIVITIES**

**5.1        Member Mail List and Member Web Site**

The Forum shall maintain a Member Mail List and Member Web Site that are not accessible by the public.  The following matters may be posted to the Member Mail List and Member Web Site:

(a)        Draft minutes of Forum meetings (both virtual and in-person, and including any sub-groups or committees) will be posted to the Member Mail List to allow Members to make sure they are being correctly reported.

Minutes will be considered Final when approved at a subsequent Forum Meeting or Forum Teleconference, or after 2 weeks have elapsed since publication of the draft if no Forum Meeting or Forum Teleconference is imminent. Final minutes will then be posted to the Public Mail List and Public Web Site. The Chair will, upon request, make redactions of any part of the public copy of the minutes identified as private or sensitive by either the information discloser or a member mentioned or affiliated with the subject of the information.

(b)        Nominations for officer positions, Forum Meeting and Forum Teleconference scheduling issues, and discussion of Forum financial issues.

**5.3        Working Groups**

Members may propose by ballot the appointment of Working Groups open to participation by Members and Interested Parties.  The ballot shall outline the scope of the Working Group's activities, including deliverables, any limitations, and Working Group expiration date.  Upon approval of the Working Group, the Chair will call for a show of interest in participation by Members, and shall appoint a Working Group Chair from among the interested Members.

Upon creation of a Working Group, the Forum will post an invitation to all Interested Parties to participate, and will solicit others with expertise and interest in the Working Group subject matter to become Interested Parties and participate in the Working Group.   With the approval of the Chair, Working Groups may establish separate list-servs, wikis, and web pages for their communications, but all such separate list-servs must be managed in the same fashion as the Public Mail List.  Working Groups may meet by teleconference or face-to-face meetings upon approval by the Chair and the Working Group Chair, but the Forum shall not be responsible for the expenses of any such teleconferences or meetings.

Working Groups may draft recommendations to be forwarded to the Forum for its consideration, but no recommendations will be considered the product of the Working Group unless approved by two-thirds of all Working Group members who vote on the recommendations.  All substantial initial and final drafts of the Working Group product will be posted on the Public Mail List.

The Forum shall review the final recommendations from a Working Groups and may approve and implement some or all of the recommendations as appropriate in the Forum's judgment following the Forum's regular voting rules. The Forum shall retain the right to amend a Working Group recommendation before approval, but in most cases should first return the proposed amended recommendation to the Working Group for its review and response before voting.

The Forum shall not be required to submit any matter to a Working Group, but may itself draft requirements and guidelines without a Working Group in its discretion.

**5.4 Forum Teleconferences and Forum Meetings**

From time to time the Forum will hold Forum Teleconferences and Forum Meetings among the Members and Associate Members, who may participate in person or (where feasible) by teleconference.

**CAB Forum Code of Conduct (the "Code")**

The CAB Forum (the "Forum") is comprised of a global group of professionals with differences in language, skills, expertise, experience, and backgrounds.  To maintain a professional and productive environment, it is necessary for Members of the Forum to follow the letter and spirit of this Code.  This Code applies to all official Forum activities, such as meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences, and other Forum functions.  The Forum is committed to maintaining a professional and respectful environment.

All Member representatives are expected to behave in a collegial and professional manner in accordance with this Code.  Members will familiarize their representatives with this Code and require them to comply with the letter and spirit of this Code.

**I.  Conduct.**  The Forum is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.  The Forum recognizes and appreciates that its participants have diverse languages, backgrounds, experience, and expertise, and expects that all participants will be treated with respect by all other participants.

(a)  In connection with official Forum activities, all Forum participants shall:
•	Be polite, kind, and courteous to other participants, refraining from insulting remarks on the perceived intelligence or ability of others.
•	Treat fellow Forum participants with respect, professionalism, courtesy, and reasonableness.  
•	Respect that people have differences of opinion, and that there is seldom unanimous agreement on a single "correct" answer.  Be willing to compromise and agree to disagree.  

(b)  In connection with official Forum activities, all Forum participants shall refrain from conduct such as:  
•	Threatening violence towards anyone.  
•	Discriminating against anyone on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
•	Harassing or bullying anyone verbally, physically, or sexually.
•	Launching barbs at others.  [Note:  a "barb" is an obviously or openly unpleasant or carping remark.]
•	Touching another person in a physically inappropriate way. 
•	Deliberately intimidating or stalking another person (in-person, online, or by other means).
•	Inappropriately disrupting or impeding official Forum events, including meetings, talks, and presentations.  For purposes of this Code, "inappropriate disruption" would include aggressive, violent, and abusive conduct that prevents an official Forum event from occurring or proceeding.
•	Spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, and other similar behavior inappropriately directed towards an individual.
•	Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

(c)  All Forum participants should promote the rules of this Code and take action to bring discussions back into compliance with the Code whenever violations are observed.

(d)  Forum participants should stick to ideological, conceptual discussions and avoid engaging in offensive or sensitive personal discussions, particularly if they're off-topic; such personal discussions can lead to unnecessary arguments, hurt feelings, and damaged trust. 

**II.  Moderation.**  These are the policies for upholding the Code.

(a) Resist the urge to be defensive.  Remember that it's your responsibility to clearly communicate your message to your fellow participants. Everyone wants to get along and we are all in the Forum first and foremost because we want to talk about standards and everything that involves. Other participants will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you have earned their trust.

(b)  Participants should inform the Chair, Vice Chair, and/or a Working Group Chair immediately if they feel they have been, or are being, harassed or made uncomfortable by a Forum member. Intimidation, personal attacks, and retaliation of any kind will not be tolerated. 

(c)  Any Forum participant may report, in good faith, a perceived violation of the Code to the Forum Chair or Vice Chair, or to a Working Group Chair (each, a "Code Liaison").  One or more Code Liaison(s) will work with the reported Forum participant to determine whether a violation of the Code has occurred and, if so, how to resolve it.  Resolution may also include appropriate executives from the Forum participant's Member company, as appropriate.  If the reported Forum participant, Member executives, and the Code Liaison(s) are unable to resolve the issue, any of the foregoing may request the assistance of a reasonably acceptable independent third party (such as an Interested Party or WebTrust) to assist with the resolution. 

(d)  Members agree to take appropriate action in the event any of their Member representatives violate the Code.  Such action could include warning, reprimanding, suspending, removing or replacing the Member representative who has violated the Code, depending on the severity of the violation.  Depending on the number and severity of violations, the Forum may impose consequences such as excluding a Member representative from certain meetings, removing a Member representative from a mailing list, and suspending a Member representative from certain Forum activities.
